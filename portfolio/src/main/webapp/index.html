            <h2>About Me</h2>

                studying Computer Engineering.Born and raised in the New York City Metropolitan 
                Area,  I've always had a passion for CS; Being amazed on how a 
                little bit of knowledge in coding has the ability to change
                the world. </p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p> Besides coding, I like to spend my time watching and playing
            soccer with friends and family. As a huge fan of Chelsea FC, I've
            been able to watch them lift multiple trophies. Besides soccer,
            I like to hang out with friends, ranging from playing video games
            to going out and grabbing something to eat 
            </p>
