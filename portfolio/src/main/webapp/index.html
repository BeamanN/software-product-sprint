        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hey everyone, my name is Beaman Negash and I'm a 
            rising junior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick 
            studying Computer Engineering.</p>
        <p> Born and raised in the New York City Metropolitan Area,  
            I've always had a passion for CS; Being amazed on how a 
            little bit of knowledge in coding has the ability to change
            the world. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p> Besides coding, I like to spend my time watching and playing
            soccer with friends and family. As a huge fan of Chelsea FC, I've
            been able to watch them lift multiple trophies. Besides soccer,
            I like to hang out with friends, ranging from playing video games
            to going out and grabbing something to eat 
        </p>
