                    Coronavirus disease is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus is thought to spread mainly between people 
                    who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or 
                    sneezes. It is also possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their 
                    own mouth, nose, or eyes. For more information go to CDC’s Fact Sheet- What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

                <li>
                    Risk of infection with COVID-19 is higher for people who are in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19, such as healthcare workers, 
                    direct support providers, and household members. Other people at higher risk for infection are those who live or have recently been in an area with 
                    ongoing spread of COVID-19.

                    Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus first identified in 2019, and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu. However, as more people become fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 should slow down. More information about COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compared to flu, COVID-19 can cause more serious illnesses in some people. COVID-19 can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because some of the symptoms of flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory illnesses are similar, the difference between them cannot be made based on symptoms alone. Testing is needed to tell what the illness is and to confirm a diagnosis. People can be infected with both flu and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time and have symptoms of both influenza and COVID-19.

                    While more is learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, there are still things, such as post-COVID conditions, that are unknown. This page compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.

                <p>
                    COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. 
                    The vaccines met the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, 
                    and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines since they were authorized for emergency use by FDA. These vaccines 
                    have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. This monitoring includes using both 
                    established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.
